                My journey began by following the first programming tutorials on
                the well-known website
                <a href="https://www.html.it/">html.it</a>.
                Later on, I started reading books—among the ones that shaped me
                the most are <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html">
                Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> and
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language">
                The C Programming Language</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                I completed many courses on Coursera and constantly searched for
                new information through books and technical documentation
                available online.

                Among the websites that were most useful to me are
                <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> and
                <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, where I
                studied source code and discovered innovations that were
                previously unknown to me.
                Over time, I began contributing to FOSS projects whenever I
                could.

                I worked as a programmer. This was my first real work
                experience, where I learned patience, especially in the role of
                a service provider, as well as discipline and method in a large
                team environment.
                I worked on proprietary-framework-based software using
                JavaScript and Java 5.
                I also learned to use Oracle as a DBMS, which I hadn’t
                studied before.
                We used SVN for version control and a bug tracker to manage
                internal task coordination.

              <p>
                This experience taught me how to make smart decisions based on
                the variables at play and how to lead a small team with greater
                responsibilities.

                I had to build a department from scratch, balancing functional
                and technical aspects, passion and rationality.
                I studied and applied the SCRUM methodology using Trello as a
                virtual kanban board.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a version control system, I used GIT, which I had already
                mastered through personal projects.
                Our team developed several microservices that were part of a
                centralized core project.
                The main technologies I chose were Java 8, PHP 7.3, JavaScript,
                HTML, and CSS.
                I developed WordPress plugins to interact with the core service.
              </p>
              <p>
                We used Laravel and Lumen primarily for admin interfaces and
                secondary microservices. For some web apps, we used React.js.
                The core service had two main components: a web service in
                Vert.x (Java 8) and a batch system built with a proprietary
                framework.
                The main DBMS was PostgreSQL, and I made extensive use
                of PLPGSQL.
              </p>
              <p>
                As I began hiring junior developers, I used pair programming to
                teach and identify potential bottlenecks.
                For infrastructure, we opted for unmanaged cloud solutions for
                maximum flexibility.

              <p>
                This experience introduced me to the startup world—highlighting
                the flexibility required of software and the importance of solid
                architectural design in a fully cloud-based environment.
                We launched a new product in the Italian market that tracks
                ecommerce revenue and expenses across multiple channels to
                suggest optimal budgeting strategies for users.
              </p>
              <p>
                Together with the team, we experienced the pressure of working
                in a startup, while also enjoying building something
                we believed in.
                Technologies were all based on Google Cloud Platform.
                The project was divided into three main modules:
                showcase, academy, and analytics (the business core).
              </p>
              <p>
                I became proficient with Google Cloud Functions (Node.js-based),
                used to handle events.
                The dashboard was built with PHP 7.3 using Laravel, retrieving
                and visualizing data from PostgreSQL (Google Cloud SQL) with
                charts and tables, allowing user customization.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although we primarily used PostgreSQL, we also experimented
                with Google Data Studio, developing a custom Google Data Source
                via BigQuery.
                We used Memcache for sessions and caching.
                The dashboard ran on Google Cloud Run
                (a Kubernetes abstraction layer),with events traveling through
                Pub/Sub to trigger functions.
                Static file persistence was managed through Google Cloud
                Storage, behind Google Cloud Load Balancing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thanks to this setup, we achieved 100% uptime, which was
                critical for our use case. We also integrated directly with
                Google Tag Manager by developing a custom template.
                Another key skill I developed was the creation and analysis of
                metrics, which was crucial both for monitoring software
                performance and cost optimization.
